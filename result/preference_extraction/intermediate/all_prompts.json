Review: Before I bought this product, I tried setting eyelets with a HomePro 2 Hand Eyelet Tool. However the eyelet setter kept sliding back into its base, which made the tool unusable. I next tried a hammer and punch, after first punching a hole in the card stock. This technique worked, although the eyelets tended to deform into peculiar shapes, and I whacked my thumb with the hammer a couple of times. The Crop-A-Dile II Big Bite Punch (CAD II BBP)is my third attempt to set eyelets, and it performs better than the first two methods. However, the CAD II BBP is by no means perfect. The top and bottom cubes that rotate so you can punch the correct size of eyelet have a bit of wiggle room, so that the top and bottom points don't come precisely together. The tool can still set eyelets, but one side of the eyelet gets a bit more squashed down than the other side. My favorite feature, and the reason I bought the CAD II BBP is its long reach. If I choose to, I can set eyelets in the middle of my greeting cards instead of having to limit myself to the edges of the cards. The HomePro 2 Hand Eyelet Tool (while it was still working) could only set eyelets at the edges of cards.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

This particular example, the Holiday Cardinal yields twelve pieces of paper: the oval ivy border itself, which measures about four inches in length and three inches in width; there are also five sets of berries; the cardinal's body plus separate pieces for its black mask, yellow beak and feet, and black eye. Text-weight (60 lb) paper seems to yield the cleanest cut. When I attempted to cut regular cardstock (80 lb) with this die, I had to finish the cut with my trusty #11 X-Acto blade. All of the Cottage Cutz dies come with a thin piece of sticky-backed foam that you fit over the die face. That's all the preparation that is necessary to use their dies. I attempted to cut this die with both my Big Shot die cutting machine and my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine, but neither yielded a completely clean cut, even when I used a shim. It took an extra fifteen minutes to free up the oval ivy border from the excess card stock. Please see customer image above for an example of a Christmas greeting card that was made with this die.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I like to use these blue, pink, and green plastic penguin 'cabochons' (dimensional stickers) for embellishing my Christmas cards, both inside and out. These 12 penguins (skating and standing) can be used singly or in groups to decorate cards (see customer image for an example of a Christmas card with 4 of the penguins). The standing penguins are embellished with little fuzzy balls on their caps. You simply peel the penguins off of the clear plastic sheet inside the package, and stick them to your card or scrapbook page.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

You can reposition them all day. My problem is that they didn't bond the interior vellum sheet of my wedding card to the exterior paper. I tried three separate sheets out of a package of ten, and all they did was make the paper, the vellum, and ultimately my hands slightly sticky. Possibly the adhesive sheets didn't work because I had the sealed package in my possession for a couple of years before I tried them out, and the glue somehow evaporated. Needless to say, the sheets went into the wastebasket, and I resorted to Plan B which was tying the vellum interior to the exterior card with a ribbon. I won't buy this particular Glue Dots product again, even though I regularly use their other products.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

However, when used with a Cuttlebug machine, it doesn't completely cut out the letters, especially the curly bits, and I have to go after them with a craft knife. It sometimes takes half an hour to free the letters from the surrounding paper, which isn't what I would call a time-saver. However, the results are very pretty. See customer image above for one of the greeting cards I made from this die, plus a die from the&nbsp;Spellbinders S5-051 Mega Dies Fanciful Flight&nbsp;package. Here is the layering technique that, after much experimentation, I learned gives the best results with this Sizzix die in the Cuttlebug machine (from the bottom up): A Plate Cuttlebug manual (for padding) B Plate Happy Birthday die with cutting edge face-up paper with decorative side face-down B Plate\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Silver was also the only ink to show a true metallic sheen. These pens are still usable, if I retrace my lines until the color is uniform, but a better set of metallic markers is manufactured by Prang:&nbsp;Prang Metallic Washable Marker. You also get an extra color (green) from Prang, and the Prang set is cheaper. Both sets of markers are advertised as acid-free (archival quality) but the Prang markers flow more freely and create a broader line. Both sets of pens can be used on dark or light paper. Prang markers dry within seconds on glossy paper. e.g.photographs. The American Crafts pens smudged on glossy paper after being allowed to dry for a minute. Maybe I got a bad set of American Crafts metallic markers, but I'm definitely a convert to the Prang brand.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

They are usually a good size for A2 greeting cards (5.5\" x 4.25\") and cut very well on my Spellbinders Grand Calibur machine. I personally think they cut better than the Spellbinder dies. I have used at least one of my Die-Namics dies well over a hundred times and it still cuts sharply. These Happy Hello dies can be used to decorate Friendship A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") greeting cards. See customer image for a Friendship card I made from the largest 'Hello' die. This is one of the two dies out of a group of six, where the letters are not connected, so you will have to line them up before you glue them to your card.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

This particular example, the Carousel Silhouette die yields four pieces of paper: the carousel silhouette which measures about 3.5 inches in width; and three pony cut-outs. Text-weight (60 lb) paper seems to yield the cleanest cut. When I attempted to cut regular cardstock (80 lb) with this die, I had to finish the cut with my trusty #11 X-Acto blade. Most Cottage Cutz dies come with a thin piece of sticky-backed foam that you fit over the die face. That's all the preparation that is necessary to use their dies. I attempted to cut this die with my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine, but it didn't yield a completely clean cut, even when I used a shim. The glitter card stock that I used for the ponies was especially resistant to being cut with this die. Please see customer image above for an example of a birthday greeting card that was made with this die.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Another problem with this system is that the punches wiggle around in the border system, also making alignment difficult. The advantage to the Tonic Studios system is that you can use many different punches with the same border guide. However, I find the Fiskars border punches, e.g.&nbsp;Fiskars 12-23367097 Border Punch Sunburst&nbsp;and Martha Stewart edgers e.g.Martha Stewart Edger Floral Lace&nbsp;much easier to align and use on my greeting card edges. Martha Stewart border punches have matching corner punches, e.g.&nbsp;Martha Stewart Pansy Edge Punch Around the Page, so you can decorate all the way around a sheet of paper. I haven't tried out the corner punches yet because I usually just punch a border on one edge of my card.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

See customer images above for a Christmas card I made, using all parts of this die set. I use my Spellbinders Shapeabilities dies with a Spellbinders Wizard machine. The directions on how to use these dies with Spellbinders Wizard, the Big Kick by Sizzix, and the Cuttlebug by Provocraft come with every set of dies, and they are very clear and easy to follow. I've noticed with some of the more elaborate dies that it helps to run the die through the Wizard once in one direction, then rotate the die and paper 90 degrees and run it through a second time, just to be sure every little curlique cuts completely. I didn't have to make two passes with these poinsettia dies. If you are going to emboss using a Wizard or a Cuttlebug, and the Shapeabilities Spellbinders dies, you will also need to purchase&nbsp;Spellbinders W-023 Enlarged Embossing Pads for Wizard Cutting and Embossing System&nbsp;or something similar. P.S. I'm not sure why Spellbinders included two of the circle cluster dies. It would have made more sense to include two leaf dies, so we could cut out two leaves at once.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Title: Nice range of colors Review: I like Stickles glitter glue for decorating greeting cards. Whenever I run out of a color from my&nbsp;Martha Stewart Crafts Glitter Glue Set, 24 Per Pack, I get single color replacement glitter glues from Stickles. The Stickles bottle has a narrow aperture, so it is easy to place small dabs of glitter/glue where you need it. See customer image above for an example of a greeting card I made using Stickles Glitter glue (the outline around the embossed image). Title: Cheaper elsewhere Review: I like Stickles silver glitter glue, and generally order it 3 bottles at a time (for $1.89/bottle) from one of the online craft stores. I thought maybe the product on this page was multiple bottles because of the price, but I don't see any text that says the price is for multiple bottles. In that case, it's way overpriced. At any rate, I'm always running out of silver from my&nbsp;Ek Success Martha Stewart Glitter Glue Set, 24 Per Pack, so I get single color replacement glitter glues from Stickles. The Stickles bottle has a narrow aperture, so it is easy to place small dabs of glitter/glue where you need it.

It turned out to be difficult to use. It's hard to line up the corners inside this punch, as contrasted with my Tonic corner punch which has a little apron beneath the punch that makes lining up the card stock quite easy. This Fiskars punch also works quite stiffly. I have to stand up and push down hard to get it to punch cardstock. Sometimes the punch sticks in the 'down' position and I have to rap it on the table to get it unstuck. The punched-out patterns are useful and it's nice having three of them in one punch.

Plus some of the interior sheets had smudges and dents on them. Each of the 24 12\"x12\" sheets has non-removable glitter on one side with a shiny white backing. Unfortunately, when I ran a sheet through my Spellbinder's Grand Calibur die-cutting machine, the two sides had a tendency to separate. The sheet was difficult to cut, owing to the elasticity of the top glittery layer, even when I used a shim (extra layer of card stock). There are two sheets of each color, and the colors that came with my stack are: lime green; cool light green; light blue; gold (4 sheets); a sort of brass green; fuschia; dark fuschia; dark violet; dark gold; black; and silver.

If you like to use a brayer to color your backgrounds (see customer image of a sympathy card where I used a brayer to add sepia ink to the embossed background), this pad is sized just right. The Archival Inks dry waterproof, so I can use them in conjunction with watercolors.

Imagine my surprise when I lifted the weight in the morning and the card came with it. It was relatively easy to separate everything because the glue was still tacky. It had never dried. In order to remove the excess glue from my picture mount, I had to resort to a craft knife. 'Memory Mount' advertises itself as 'Archival quality,' 'acid free,' and 'non caustic.' If you are looking for a glue that stays tacky for a long time, it might be just the product for you. Its tackiness reminded me of a wad of bublegum I had to scrape off the seat edge at the last theatre I attended. Unfortunately, I was looking for a glue that dried hard so 'Memory Mount' was a bad experience for me. It does dry clear, which is good.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Among the more than 45 projects by this HGTV `Queen of Crafting' are greeting cards made from toilet paper. Okay, partially made from toilet paper (see \"Molded Tissue Cards\")--and they are really cute! Even though this book is only partially concerned with greeting cards, it contains some of the best and newest (and sometimes, weirdest) ideas for crafting cards that I have yet seen. In addition to cards, the author also teaches her readers how to make paper napkin rings, mobiles, gift boxes, picture frames, coasters, and even working clocks crafted from paper bags. Each project is divided into illustrated steps, and several variations of the finished product are shown. The materials list for each project tends to be shorter than in similar books. You don't have to go out and buy fifteen different doodads and gizmos in order to complete a single card.

This particular example, Autumn Centerpiece yields 18 pieces of paper, and you are going to have to run the die through your die-cutting machine three times in order to cut three candles. This Cottage Cutz die comes with a thin piece of sticky-backed foam that you fit over the die face. That's all the preparation that is necessary to use the die. I cut this die with my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine, and used a metal shim to get a clean cut. You will be doing quite a bit of gluing with your 54 bits of paper (remember, you need to run the die through your machine 3 times). It is quite a bit of fuss, but the end result is very nice.

Review: My husband and I buy Dritz Deluxe Seam Rippers a dozen at a time. I actually do use them for ripping out seams, but their main purpose in our household, is to remove hair clumps from our long-haired Maine Coon cats. We've tried other brands, including the longer 'red' seam ripper and were amazed at the difference between the products. The 'red' model was too dull right out of the wrapper to cut cat hair! The normal clump-removal tools that can be found in pet catalogues are too big and clumsy to use on a cat, especially for the matted hair that accumulates between the upper leg and the body (armpit? Do cats have armpits?). This seam ripper works perfectly to separate the mat from the skin. There are two things you need to be careful of when using this product to de-mat your cat: (1) Don't poke kitty with the sharp end of the tool. You have one seam ripper, but your cat has eighteen! (2) Don't pull on the hair clump while you are cutting it away from the skin. If you tug at the mat, you might accidentally pull kitty's hide up into the razor-sharp crescent blade, and cut it. We originally learned about this novel use for a seam ripper from a man who shows Maine Coons, and have been using it successfully for many years.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

One of my favorite techniques is to spread colors randomly on a wet sheet of Hot Pressed 140 lb. Aquarelle Arches watercolor paper, then cover the wet paint with Saran Wrap and wrinkle the Saran Wrap. See customer image for examples produced by this technique. One of my problems with this technique was the watercolors would dry before I applied the Saran Wrap. My art teacher recommended Winsor & Newton Water Color Blending Medium to keep the water colors wet until I applied the Saran Wrap, and this product worked perfectly for me. I had to leave the Saran Wrap on the paper for a longer period of time, because the water colors took longer to dry, but the blending medium yielded beautiful results.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I bought these Action Wobble Springs to make my cards more three-dimensional (see customer image above for a Halloween card I made with one of these springs). The springs are very easy to use: pull the paper backing off of one side of the spring and stick the transparent remainder to your object (I had to trim quite a bit of the sticky transparency away from my object, as it was smaller than the backing). Peel the paper backing off of the bottom of the spring and stick the remaining transparent circle to your card. There were two minor issues with these springs: (1) The springs are too stiff to allow the object to wobble, although they hold it away from the card front very well. (2) The transparent circle on the bottom of the spring has advertising text on it that I had to cut away because it didn't fit with the card's theme. If your object is bigger than the backing, you won't have to worry about this.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Their tools punch more cleanly. I often have problems getting a cleanly punched border from the Martha Stewart systems, even after I run aluminum foil through them to clean them out. All of the Fiskars punches are easy to line up over a previously punched area, so that you can punch a continuous border. This particular punch makes a pretty vine-and-flower border for a feminine-looking card. It could be used for anything from birthday to wedding cards. My one complaint about all of the border punch systems that I've used so far, is that I can't get them to cleanly punch anything heavier than 80 lb. card stock.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

(2) Putting a new roll of tape onto the glider is quite a fiddly process. I have wrecked whole rolls of tape in my efforts to place the roll properly on the glider.

I'm really happy that I'm not finding bent tips on my favorite brushes when I store them in my new ArtBin.

By the end of the year, both sides of my cutting plate are looking pretty shabby and sometimes the left-over marks rub off on the new piece of paper that I'm cutting.

Review: I bought this Uchida 90G-C Marvy Jewel Picker at the same time I also purchased a&nbsp;Wax Rhinestone Picker Pencil---by Pixiheart, so I was able to compare the two products head-to-head. The wax pencil did a better job of picking up and holding small rhinestones, AND it was half again as cheap as this product. Plus, when the pencil loses its adhesion, I can sharpen it with a regular pencil sharpener, and it starts to pick up small objects just as if it were new, again. I don't know of a way of 'refurbishing' this Marvy product. I was using tweezers to pick up small rhinestones and place them on my greeting cards, and both the Marvy Jewel Picker and the Rhinestone Picker Pencil work better than tweezers, and I am able to place my rhinestones much more precisely. However, I would definitely recommend the wax picker pencil over this Marvy Jewel Picker.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

This particular die makes quite an elegant corner for a variety of different cards, including wedding, friendship, and birthday. Please see customer image above for a birthday card that I decorated with this die. I used my Spellbinder's Grand Calibur die cutting machine for this die, and I had trouble getting a clean cut on regular cardstock, until I inserted a shim (an extra piece of paper to press the cardstock down into the die) between the plate and the cardstock. I wish these corner dies came in pairs, with one die the mirror-image of the other, so that I could place a die-cut in opposite corners of the card. You can't just flip the die-cut over to get matching corners, as one side of the cut is rounded and the other side is flat.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

These are the problems I have with it: -The cord is only 56\" long and the enclosed directions forbid the use of an extension cord. -The directions also state that this product should be used with an ironing board. One of the reasons I bought this mini iron was to avoid having to set up the ironing board. I ignored this particular instruction, and used a cloth napkin on a wooden table as my 'ironing board'--a low wooden table, since the iron's cord is so short. -Even though I let the mini iron heat up for several minutes, it didn't perform efficiently. My ribbon still had wrinkles after I finished ironing it. There is no light that goes on when the iron is hot enough, and nothing in the enclosed directions states how long it takes for the iron to heat up to its working temperature. I would have thought that five minutes should have been more than enough time for this mini iron to reach maximum temperature. My advice to potential buyers: don't waste your money on this mini crafting iron.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Review: One of my biggest gripes against decorative die manufacturers (such as Spellbinders) is that they don't size their dies to fit on standard American card sizes such as A2 (4.25\"x5.5\") or A7 (5\"x7\"). One die that I really wanted was a mat for my A2 cards. The large rectangle (4\"x5.25\") in this set from Die-Namics cuts perfect mats for A2 cards, and it's my most-used die. The squiggly rectangle makes a nice frame that fits within the mat (see customer image for a sample friendship card that uses these dies plus the middle rectangle). The smaller rectangles (2.5\"x3.75\" and 2.25\"x3.5\") also make nice frames within the A2 mat. I haven't used the round dies yet but the smallest dies make neat labels (I print my text on the computer, then center and tape the die over the print and run it through my&nbsp;Spellbinders Grand Calibur Die Cutting Machine. These dies are a bit pricey, but they're worth it to me. They come on a magnetized sheet for easy storage.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

These micro dots solved my problem, and 'pop up' small decorations on my cards, giving them a three-dimensional quality. See customer image above for an example of a birthday card that has 15 micro dots adhering to the lizards' feet and tails. These dots aren't perfect. They're a bit hard to pry up.

I create the raised pattern on cardstock by running the cardstock and embossing folder through my Cuttlebug machine. I either leave the raised pattern uncolored or else use a cosmetic sponge and an ink pad to dab color on the raised portion. Chalk could also be used, but you would probably want to use a sealant to keep the chalk from migrating off of the card surface.

I ran this die through my Sizzix Big Shot machine. The directions that came with the die showed how to set up the 'sandwich' of two cutting pads plus paper plus this die, although they aren't specific for the Heart flip-its die. My problem came after I cut the paper when I had to fold it into the correct shape. There are no directions that show how to fold the paper into a card with the heart cut-out in the right place. Luckily, there is a video on YouTube that demonstrates how to fold the paper for a Sizzix Flip-its die, although it uses a die other than the Heart flip-its. Just search for 'Sizzix flip-its' on the web and click on the YouTube video. Another problem is the size of the card, which doesn't fit into any of the standard envelope sizes that I use for my other greeting cards. Once folded, the card measures about 5\"x5\" (depending on how well you folded it). However, 5.5\"x5.5\" envelopes can be purchased at paper supply stores (I got mine at paper-paper.com) which can be used with these flip-its cards.

I'd call the effect more of a subdued glimmer. I'm not totally crazy about the color selection. The light pink is quite subdued, almost dusty-looking.

Cardstock (80 lb.) yields a clean cut when I use the&nbsp;CottageCutz Universal Shim Plate Die Cuts&nbsp;in combination with this die.

This is the 5th issue of the \"Tattered Lace\" magazine which has the 4\"x2.5\" Rambling Rose die attached to it. Inside there are illustrated instructions on how to use this particular die, and many of the instructions also include other Tattered Lace dies such as the 'Basket Full of Delight' die. All of the instructions come with step-by-step color photographs. Some of the other dies featured in projects in this issue are the 'Mini Blooms' die set, the 'Mannequin' die set, the 'Lacy Chrysanthemum' die set, the 'Frippery & Frills' dies, the 'Rocking Horse die, the 'Venetian Swag' die set, the 'Doily Delights' die, the 'Kensington' die set the 'Venetian Floral' die set, the 'Venetian Fern' die, and the 'Chantilly Rose' die. All come with step-by-step tutorials. You will have to purchase these dies separately. A really cute special feature shows how to make a fairground carousel box using the carousel template in the magazine, the Rocking Horse die, the Venetian Swag die set, pink polka dot cardstock (a free download), pink polka dot organza ribbon, ultra fine glitter, and faux pearls.

I use the&nbsp;Darice 2704-01 Rhinestone Setter Hot-Fix Applicator Wand&nbsp;to fasten these rhinestones to my cardstock. The only drawback: the rhinestones don't attach very well to any kind of shiny or foil cardstock, and I have to resort to regular glue. I've also attached these hot fix rhinestones to cloth with no problems. These threadart rhinestones are less expensive than their Swarovski counterparts, and sparkle with all the colors of an aurora.

I stamp the pictures first, then fit the dies around the pictures and cut them with my Sizzix Big Shot. These dies yield a good, clean cut but to tell the truth, it would have been almost as easy to cut the stamped images by hand. You will have to do some hand-cutting in order to remove the waste paper from the center of the rings. I would have much preferred to have a die that cut out the center of the rings. It's relatively difficult to find stamps and dies for wedding cards, so I was happy to find this set from Sizzix (I paid much less for the set at scrapbook.com). Please see customer image for a wedding card that I made with these stamps and dies (the rings).\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

If my paper art magazines are to be trusted, birdcages are currently a trendy decoration for greeting cards, and this set of dies plays right into that trend. My only problem with this set of 'Bird Santuary' dies is that the large bird doesn't fit into either cage, and the smallest cage won't hold either bird. I use my Spellbinders Shapeabilities dies with a Cuttlebug machine. The directions on how to use these dies with the Spellbinders Wizard, the Big Kick by Sizzix, and the Cuttlebug by Provocraft come with every set of dies, and they are very clear and easy to follow. If you are going to emboss using a Cuttlebug and the Shapeabilities Spellbinders dies, you will also need to purchase a tan embossing mat which is sold separately from the Cuttlebug machine.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

The individual strands kept splitting, knotting, and breaking while I was attempting to embroider the card in the customer image.

If I tried to use extra pressure on the scissors, they locked up and wouldn't cut at all. Another not-so-great feature is the short length of the cutting blades on the Fiskars Paper Edgers. They will only cut 2.5\" at a time, so you have to keep lining up blades to the cut edge, if you want to cut a longer length. The decorative-edge scissors that I use most often are&nbsp;Fiskars 98987097 Softgrip Pinking Fabric Shears, which are quite a bit more expensive, but they cut a longer edge, and you can use them on heavier paper or cloth. Unfortunately, there isn't a large variety of edge designs in this product line.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

So I asked the owners of a Maine Coon cattery how they removed the clumps of fur from their show cats, and they told me to get a seam ripper. This small seam ripper from Dritz is perfect for eliminating the clumped fur on my cat. I've tried other brands of seam ripper, but the blades aren't sharp enough. This seam ripper fits perfectly into my hand. For some reason, the blade on this small seam ripper seems sharper than the one on the longer model.

I have used the latter product for a few decades and it worked well, but now the rubber tray on the bottom that holds the discarded paper 'holes' keeps falling off. The Bostich model also has a rubber or plastic tray, but it seems to fit more tightly to the metal punch. Incidentally, the Bostich model is advertised as 'all metal' on the box, but the tray for the discarded paper 'holes' is either rubber or flexible plastic. The Bostich model is also advertised as punching up to 12 sheets of paper at a time. I was able to punch 8 pages of typing paper comfortably. If you really do have to punch multiple sheets on a consistent basis, you might want to go with a more heavy-duty punch that has a lever arm. I was also able to punch holes in a fairly stiff piece of cardboard with the Bostich, which is important to me as I store craft dies on cardboard sheets in a three-ring binder. In summary, this Bostich 3-hole punch is easy to use although if I'm trying to punch multiple sheets of paper at a time, I sometimes have trouble fitting them neatly into the narrow slot under the punches. ***product supplied by vendor for testing and review purposes***\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I have used at least one of my Die-Namics dies well over a hundred times and it still cuts sharply. These pierced fishtail dies can be used to decorate a variety of different A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") greeting cards, including birthday and graduation cards (see customer image for a birthday card I made from one of these dies). I should have paid more attention to the length of these fishtail dies. I used the 3rd and 4th largest fishtail dies to make the card in the customer image, and they took up the whole length of the A2 card.

This particular example, 'Under the Sea' yields seven pieces of paper: two rocks or dunes; three pieces of seaweed, and a couple of pieces of coral. Regular cardstock (80 lb) yields a clean cut when I use a metal shim with my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine. I cut the die pieces on white card stock then colored them with Prismacolor pens. I had to reduce the size of the sand dunes in order to get them to fit onto an A2 (4.25\" x 5.5\") card. I'd also like to try cutting the two 'dunes' on lightweight sandpaper.

pack of methocel. Kit with assorted marbling colors is ideal for professionals, yet easy enough to use for beginners to create beautiful, unique papers for bookbinding, collage or gift wrapping. This value pack is also included with the complete instructions.', \"Use Jacquard's Marbling Kit to make beautiful patterned fabric or gift wrapping paper as unique as you are. Historically, the art of marbling paper has been associated with the craft of bookbinding. This technique involves creating a multi-colored pattern of paint that floats on the surface of a gel-like medium. Once you have mixed the paint and medium, you can lay your paper or fabric on the surface of the liquid to pick up the floating paint and transfer the design. This kit is designed to be used and enjoyed by professionals and beginners alike. The kit contains six 1/2-oz bottles of marbling colors (black, blue, green, red, yellow, and white). Also includes methocel marbling medium, alum sizing, and complete instructions. (Note: paper and fabric are not included in this kit.) For ages 12 and up. For over 30 years, Jacquard has been the leading manufacturer of artist quality textile, mixed media and craft products. Our products include textile paints, dyes, fabric art markers, screen inks and craft kits.\"]\n\n\n**Known Product Attributes (from Knowledge Base):**\n- Brand: Jacquard\n- Main Category: Arts, Crafts & Sewing\n- Category: Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Fabric & Textile Paints, Fabric Decorating\n\n**User Review Content:**\nTitle: Marbling starter kit that needs to be supplemented Review: This kit has been assembled for those of us who would like to try our hand at marbling paper or cloth. It contains: * Six oz. bottles of marbling colors (red, blue, yellow, black, green, white). Each bottle is topped with a dropper, so that you can squeeze the color directly onto the size (the gelatinous substance that the colors float on top of--if you're lucky). The white color that came with this kit was grainy. I suspect it had partially dried in the bottle. The black and green wanted to sink, but this tendency could have been due to the humidity or temperature. Size (the gel that supports the colors) is very temperamental * 5 oz. Alum Mordant--this is what you spray onto your paper to prepare it for marbling. Otherwise, the colors won't stick to the paper * 2 oz. Methocel--Blend this ingredient with warm water to make your size. I didn't use the methocel that came with this kit. I preferred making my size with Carrageenan, which had to be bought separately * Instructions on how to prepare your cloth or paper, and size. You are also instructed on how to make some of the most common marbling patterns such as `stone,' `get-gel,' or `rake Nonpareil.' Finally, you are taught how to pick up your pattern on your paper or fabric, rinse it, and then clean up afterwards (the hardest part!) There are items that this Jacquard Marbling Kit does not include, which you will have to purchase or make separately: * Paper. I have successfully marbled 140 lb. hot-pressed watercolor paper, and 110 lb. white card stock (for laser printer), after treating it with the alum mordant * A pan in which to float your size (I used a small plastic kitty litter pan) * A board to support your marbled paper while rinsing off the excess color * Various jugs to mix up your alum mordant and size (I used plastic milk bottles) * Paper drying rack (I used wire shelving, but non-rusting screens would work. You can even hang your paper to dry over a clothesline) * A board (I used an old wooden ruler) to skim the crud off of your size. You can reuse your size if you skim it between marbling patterns * Whisks, combs, and rakes to draw your patterns in the colors floating on the size. These can be purchased separately or constructed out of T-pins and strips of wood * Lots and lots of old newspaper to protect your working surface, clean up splatters, and skim off your size (wrap strips of it around your skimming board) Marbling is complicated, but fun, and you can make some seriously beautiful patterns on your cloth or paper. I use my marbled paper to fashion greeting cards. I strongly suggest that you supplement the instructions that come with this Jacquard Marbling kit. I can recommend Diane and Paul Maurer's books:&nbsp;An introduction to carrageenan and watercolor marbling&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marbling: A Complete Guide to Creating Beautiful Patterned Papers and Fabrics. A couple of other, less detailed texts are: Gabriele Gr&uuml;nebaum's&nbsp;How to Marbleize Paper: Step-by-Step Instructions for 12 Traditional Patterns (Other Paper Crafts); and a 19-page guide by Christine Cox, \"Paper Marbling Patterns and How-To\" from [...] (where I also bought most of my marbling supplies).\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I like the Stickles containers because they allow for a fine, easily-controlled flow of glitter-glue. The glitter-glue takes a few minutes to dry if you don't lay it on too thickly. This product is advertised as acid-free and non-toxic. Silver is a great all-around color to use many different types of greeting cards.

They are a good size for A2 greeting cards (5.5\" x 4.25\") and cut very well on my Spellbinders Grand Calibur machine. I personally think they cut better than the Spellbinder dies. I have used at least one of my Die-Namics dies well over a hundred times and it still cuts sharply. Having said that Die-Namics dies work on A2 cards, I need to point out that the 'Congratulations' die is too large to fit on an A2 card. Furthermore, it doesn't cut completely.

Please see customer image for an example of a Sympathy greeting card that was made with the filigree vase die. I hand-cut around the outer edge of the filigree vase to free it from the excess paper.

The ink is opaque, so you can use them over colored cardstock, although Gold Lam takes several coats before you get good coverage--see 'Birthday' on the birthday card in the customer image. One of the 'features' I dislike about marking pens (the cheap ones, at least) is that the color is absorbed by the paper and spreads into areas I don't want it to go. You don't have to worry about spreading with these inks: they go on like enamel. Maybe that's why the bottles are designed to look like fingernail polish containers. I also tried floating the inks on water to see if I could create marbled paper with them. I used 110 lb. cardstock, and the colors did take, but they were very light and their characteristic sheen didn't come through. Possibly glossy cardstock would serve as a better base for marbling with these Smooch Accent Inks. I won't be throwing away my regular marbling colors any time soon. In summary, I can highly recommend this product to add color to greeting cards, especially small, stamped images, and decorative edging.

You can either cut a decorative pattern into the corner of your card stock without using the outer cutting edge, or else you can place the outer cutting edge around its partner die (I used a piece of tape to hold them together) and cut out the whole corner, and place the cut-out on the corner of your card stock. See customer image for an example of the latter method that I used to make an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") Anniversary card. Note how the wings on the small butterflies within the pattern pop up. I covered them with silver paper. The two smaller sets of dies are suitable for A2 cards, but you will need to use the larger two sets of dies on an A7 or larger greeting card. Even the smaller die sets are not exactly sized for an A2 card, and you will get a bit of overlap in the pattern along the width of the card. I do wish die manufacturers would pay a bit more attention to the standard card sizes their customers usually work with. These dies are really made for square cards--popular in Great Britain, but not here in the United States because we get charged extra postage if we try to mail a square card.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

She wanted a comprehensive craft tool that would be universal with manufacturers' existing products, cut, emboss, be portable and be sturdy enough to withstand the test of time. As a result of Stacey's entrepreneurial spirit and her husband Jeff's creative ingenuity, the Wizard Universal Craft Tool was born, along with Spellbinders patented technology Die Templates for cutting, embossing and stenciling. Innovations continue with the Grand Calibur machine and the Presto Punch machine, the first automatic punching and embossing system. Spellbinders continues to demonstrate ingenuity, integrity and trend setting ideas, while remaining a family-owned, customer service oriented business. Spellbinders Paper Arts entered the craft and hobby market in 2003 with the introduction of the Wizard Universal Craft Tool and now has more than 250 patented and patent pending products under the trade names of Nest abilities, Edge abilities, Shape abilities, Border abilities and Nesties. The Bracket Borders One template set is a wonderful complement to the Card Creator dies template series. This seven die template set features bracket shaped edges with intricate details. There are four different edge designs and three decorative inserts. All make continuous cuts and decorative edges, by matching up registration marks on the ends of the die template. Spellbinders Border abilities dies cut, emboss and stencil with a single die template. Approximate die template sizes are: 6 x 5/8 inches, 6 x 1/4 inches and 6 x 1/8 inches.\"]\n\n**Product Features:**\n- Bracket Borders One templates have intricate details for cards or any paper projects\n- seven different border designs that make continuous cuts by matching up registration marks\n- Each template is six inches long with different widths\n\n\n**Known Product Attributes (from Knowledge Base):**\n- Brand: Spellbinders\n- Main Category: Arts, Crafts & Sewing\n- Category: Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Die-Cuts, Die-Cutting & Embossing, Scrapbooking & Stamping\n- Price Range: $10-$25\n\n**User Review Content:**\nTitle: Mix and Match these border dies on A2 Greeting Cards Review: I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library, and these border dies add an elegant touch to almost any type of A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") card.

But embossed paper is usually used for layering, so the size limitation might not be as important as it seems. I can also emboss with my Xyron Creatopia Machine, and since its embossing system consists of a set of two rollers (as opposed to the Cuttlebug's folder), I can emboss paper of any length. However, Xyron's machine has very few embossing patterns, whereas Cuttlebug has something for almost every type of card (except maybe sympathy--I use a tree embossing pattern for my sympathy cards). The hearts folder can be used for wedding, anniversary, friendship, 'missing you,' and even new baby cards. It has both intaglio and relief embossing, and is lots of fun to color (especially with chalk). I like to use a printed transparency film over the pattern to carry my message. The Cuttlebug is basically a set of two rollers that press the folder pattern (back and front) into a piece of paper as the paper and folder are fed through the rollers. It's a simple concept, and the Cuttlebug performs it really well.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

It is a good weight for producing a clean die cut. It also produces a crisp stamped image on the reverse of the textured side. I generally use the 8.5\"x11\" inch Bazzill card stock for my card base. One sheet will produce 2 A2 cards (4.25\"x5.5\"). The only problem with Bazzill card stock is that the grain runs the wrong way if I am trying to print 2 A2 cards from one 8.5\"x11\" sheet. This sometimes makes it difficult to fold the card in half. If the card stock is heavily textured, I may have to clean up the fold with a file or a small pair of scissors.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

The color makes it easier to see where it's being applied. It was far superior to the white stuff. Here is the method she taught me: (1) Use an inexpensive brush (2) Dip the brush in soapy water (3) Dip the brush in Pebeo and apply it to your watercolor where you want to save the white areas. (4) Clean the brush after you're done. The application of soapy water prior to the Pebeo keeps the brush from stiffening up. The Pebeo Drawing Gum dries at about the same speed as the white stuff and it took about the same amount of effort to peel it back off of the watercolor once it dried and had been painted over.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

See customer image for a friendship card that I made with this die. It also works well on sympathy and Easter cards. In order to color the flowers differently than the leaves, you can either do two cuts (one in green and the other in say, white) then cut the flower shapes and paste them onto the green die-cut. I took the easier route and painted the flowers white using an opaque acrilic paint (titanium white). I've purchased many dies from Cottage Cutz, and this is the first one that did not come with the stick-on plastic square that goes over the cutting edges. It works just fine without the plastic, though.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

They give better coverage than marking pens and the applicator allows you to color in very fine details. The ink is opaque, so you can use them over colored cardstock. One of the 'features' I dislike about marking pens (the cheap ones, at least) is that the color is absorbed by the paper and spreads into areas I don't want it to go. You don't have to worry about spreading with these inks: they go on like enamel. Maybe that's why the bottles are designed to look like fingernail polish containers. I also tried floating the inks on water to see if I could create marbled paper with them (as is shown in the demo video). I used 110 lb. cardstock, and the colors did take, but they were very light and their characteristic sheen didn't come through. Possibly glossy cardstock would serve as a better base for marbling with these Smooch Accent Inks. I won't be throwing away my regular marbling colors any time soon. In summary, I can highly recommend this product to add color to greeting cards, especially small, stamped images, and decorative edging.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Review: I saw the Mini Misti Stamp Tool demonstrated in a YouTube video, where the demonstrator had to restamp an image because she didn't get it dark enough the first time, and I said, \"That's the tool for me!\" I can't think how much ink and paper I've wasted over the years on bad stampings, where one or two parts of the image didn't show up very well. I've even finished a few of those partially inked images with a pen. Now, the Mini Misti gives me the power to over-stamp as many times as I want in order to get a perfect image. Yay!!! This tool also allows for perfect placement of your stamp (or stamps) on the card stock. Please see customer image of an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") friendship card with four stamped images that I made with this tool. The Mini Misti is very easy to use. I didn't even have to read the instructions, and there are lots of demonstrations out on YouTube. I only wish I hadn't bought so many wood-backed stamps over the years, because they can't be used with this amazing tool.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I make and sell cards to benefit our local library, and cards decorated with Tattered Lace dies usually sell out almost as soon as I put them out on the card rack. Cardstock (80 lb.) yields a clean cut when I use the Cottage Cutz Universal Shim in combination with this die. My only problem with the different words in this die: phrases like 'Congratulations on your new baby' are made up of different sized fonts for the different words. Some of the words are italicized and others aren't. It looks sort of thrown together. Please see customer image for an example of an A2 (5.5\"x4.25\") baby card that I made with words from this die. One of the nice features of the words in this die: the dot over the 'i' in all of the pertinent words is actually attached to the stem, so you don't have to glue it separately.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Since embossed paper is usually used for layering, so the size limitation might not be as important as it seems. I can also emboss with my&nbsp;Xyron Creatopia Machine 12-Inch-Includes 25ft Permanent Adhesive, and since its embossing system consists of a set of two rollers (as opposed to the Cuttlebug's folder), I can emboss paper of any length. However, Xyron's machine has very few embossing patterns, whereas Cuttlebug has something for almost every type of card (except maybe sympathy--I use a tree embossing pattern for my sympathy cards). The birthday folder is the one I use most often. It has both intaglio and relief embossing, and is lots of fun to color (especially with chalk).

This particular die yields 16 pieces of paper: the branch, the 'groom' (7 pieces) and the 'bride' (8 pieces). The final die cut, when glued together measures about 4.5\" wide and 2.4\" high. Cardstock (80 lb.) yields a cleaner cut when I use the&nbsp;CottageCutz Universal Shim Plate-. I cut this die from white cardstock using my&nbsp;Spellbinders Grand Calibur Die Cutting Machine, then individually colored the pieces and glued them together.

Review: I make and sell greeting cards and have a set of Prismacolor art markers that I like very much. However, I also wanted to get a set of pastel markers for cards in muted colors. These Spectrum alcohol markers are currently the rage in all of the card-making magazines, so I thought I'd give them a try. The colors are exactly what I was looking for, but there were two problems: --the colors aren't named, e.g. 'lilac' or 'deco rose' but are marked with a hieroglyphic such as 'FS1.' The color is shown on the outside of the pen, which comes with a broad and narrow tip, so you can still choose the color you want without too much trouble, but I was used to working with names. --one of the pens in my set leaked before it even arrived, and it was difficult to get the color (an unpleasing yellowish brown) off of my hands and off of the other pens.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I have tried to run both wax paper and aluminum foil through the punch, as I heard these are remedies for a sticking punch. The aluminum foil helped a bit, but I still have to rap the punch on the table to get it to unstick.

This Universal Shim Plate from Cottage Cutz solves the problem of incomplete cuts (see customer image for a card that is decorated with a die where I used this shim). I ran the die and shim through my Spellbinder Grand Calibur die cutting machine, and it was a very tight fit (I was cutting 80 lb. card stock), but it did come through with a clean cut. The directions that come with the shim show how to use it with a Cuttlebug or Big Shot die cutting machine, so you may not even want to use it with your Grand Calibur machine. Next, I tried the shim with my Sizzix Big Shot die cutting machine, using the Sizzlet die \"Happy Birthday #3\" phrase. This particular Sizzlet always gives me problems with an incomplete cut. However, when I ran it through with the shim and 80 lb. card stock, the phrase cut cleanly. So if you are having problems with incomplete cuts, you might want to give this shim a try. Even with the Big Shot, it was a tight fit using the shim, so be careful not to force your die cutter past its breaking point.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Please see customer image for an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") Christmas card that I decorated with several of these snowflake die-cuts (there are more inside the card.)

This is a very adaptable set of dies for decorating your greeting cards, and I've used them for \"Thank You,\" \"Mother's Day,\" and \"Birthday\" cards, so far. My only problem with this set of dies occurs when I try to remove the embossed and cut cardstock from the button dies. There are a couple of tiny holes where you can insert a pin and push at the cardstock, but the pin also leaves holes in the paper. I wish Spellbinders had made these holes a bit bigger, so I could have used a toothpick to remove the cardstock from the die. I use my Spellbinders Shapeabilities dies with a Cuttlebug machine. The directions on how to use these dies with the Spellbinders Wizard, the Big Kick by Sizzix, and the Cuttlebug by Provocraft come with every set of dies, and they are very clear and easy to follow. If you are going to emboss using a Cuttlebug and the Shapeabilities Spellbinders dies, you will also need to purchase a tan embossing mat such as Spellbinders W-005 12 by 12 Tan Pad for Wizard Cutting and Embossing System.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I like to use these white and silver gem and pearl clusters for embellishing my wedding cards, which I sell to benefit our local library. These stickers can be used singly as the main decoration on an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") greeting card. See customer image for an example of an A2 Friendship card using one of the larger stickers, plus the four single pearls at the corners of the card. I simply peeled the stickers off of the clear plastic sheet inside the package, and stuck them to my card. One of the pearls didn't stick very well and I had to glue it onto the card face, but that wasn't a big deal. NOTE: these stickers are rather bulky and will require protection if your greeting card is going to be mailed.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

You simply peel the stickers off of the clear plastic sheet inside the package, and stick them to your card or scrapbook page.

I like the Stickles containers because they allow for a fine, easily-controlled flow of glitter-glue. The glitter-glue takes a few minutes to dry if you don't lay it on too thickly. This product is advertised as acid-free and non-toxic. Diamond is a great all-around color to use many different types of greeting cards to add just a touch of glitter to an object. The glue itself is transparent, so all you see is a spattering of rainbow-colored glitter, once the glue dries.

You will be doing some very finicky glueing to assemble the pieces, especially the buttons which are about 3 mm wide. I colored my baby clothes and background with watercolors, added a couple of clothes posts, a bit of string, and some extra 'clothes pins' and created my card. All of the Cottage Cutz dies come with a thin piece of sticky-backed foam that you fit over the die face. That's all the preparation that is necessary to use their dies. I use my Big Shot die cutting machine for this die, as it is quite thin.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I have found that Die-Namics dies work with all major die-cutting tools on the market. They are usually a good size for A2 greeting cards (5.5\" x 4.25\") and cut very well on my Spellbinders Grand Calibur machine. I personally think they cut better than the Spellbinder dies. I have used at least one of my Die-Namics dies well over a hundred times and it still cuts sharply. Having said that Die-Namics dies work on A2 cards, I need to point out that these Tag Talk dies are better suited for A7 (5\" x 7\") cards. I found them to be a bit too large for my A2 cards See customer image for an A7 graduation card I decorated with the 'Congrats' tag die.

As with all of the Spellbinder die sets, good directions are included on how to use these dies with Cuttlebug, Big Kick & Big Shot, Spellbinders Wizard and Grand Calibur machines.

But it also works very well for coloring a raised pattern after I've run my cardstock through my Cuttlebug with an embossing folder. Please see the customer image for a sympathy card that I embossed with an autumn-themed folder, then colored with the vintage photo Distress Ink pad. The only drawback to using this Distress Ink pad is that it takes a few minutes to dry. The vintage photo color will appear to be dark brown on almost any color of card stock.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Turtlenecks are out of the question. So are chokers and 16\" necklaces. That's where these magnetic extenders come in handy. Not only do they extend the length of the necklace, they are also far easier to open and close than the necklace's original fastener because of the two magnets in the middle of the extension chain. I had a similar necklace extender (the bottom extender in the customer image) that I used for years, but decided to get a couple more so I wouldn't have to keep changing it from necklace to necklace. These new extenders (the top extender in the customer image) do the job, but they are not as well-made as my original extender. The chain loops are looser and one end just finishes up with a loop instead of a fastener. The new extenders are also slightly shorter. If I could remember where I got the original extender, I'd go back and order another pair, but these new extenders do the job. I just have a feeling they won't last as long as the old one.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Once the tape roll is loaded into this glider (a tricky process), you just pull the trigger and lay down a 1/4\" wide line of tape where ever you need it. This process is far easier than trying to measure and cut and place conventional double-sided tape. Putting a refill roll onto the Scotch Advanced Tape Glider requires a bit of patience. I've figured out about ten different ways of doing it incorrectly. Detailed instructions for replacing the refill rolls comes with the glider--it takes 8 steps, and luckily they are illustrated. Follow these steps very carefully, and you shouldn't have any trouble adding your refill rolls (unless you were born with no sense of 3-D geometry like I was).\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Review: I paint watercolors, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much water these all-purpose brushes hold. You can spent a lot more for a watercolor brush (especially for natural bristles such as sable), but if you are a beginner or happy amateur such as myself, these De Dazzle brushes will work just fine. They keep their points, distribute the paint evenly, and are easy to clean. This set does not contain any large round brushes, which you will definitely need for watercolor, but there are plenty of brushes you can use as small flats and riggers. Two of my favorite brushes that are not included in this set are the Cotman #14 and #10 rounds, and I also use a large flat brush for washes. This De Dazzle set plus the rounds plus a large flat brush for washes should get you off to a great and relatively inexpensive start in the wonderful world of watercolor. ***product supplied by vendor for review and test purposes***\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

However, this punch creates decorate corner slots for inserts such as photographs. I used it to create an Easter card (see customer image). Easy-to-follow directions come with the punch, although they are displayed in really small print (English, French, and Spanish). I didn't have any problems following the diagrams and the text. The problem came when I tried to figure out what size of insert would best fit into the four slots I had created. The size of the front of the greeting card determines the size of the insert. You don't really get to choose the size of the insert, as the placement of the corner slots is set by lining up the edges of the card with the plastic extensions on the punch.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

However, there is one huge problem for those of us who want to make two standard A2 (4.25\"x5.5\") cards from a single piece of Bazzill Basics stock: the grain runs the wrong way on the paper. When I fold the paper (it doesn't matter whether I'm making a side-fold or a top-fold card) it is a struggle to get it to fold straight, and I often have to cut away little bits of paper that popped up along the fold. If you are printing two A2 cards on one sheet of Bazzill Basic stock, you'll just have to live with the problem of the grain going the wrong way. I still use this paper because I like its weight and the wide range of available colors. This pink dotted Swiss paper makes nice baby girl and Sweet Sixteen greeting cards.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Please see the customer image for a baby card that I embossed with a swirl-themed folder, then colored with the antique linen Distress Ink pad (the background to the main image). The only drawback to using this Distress Ink pad is that it takes a few minutes to dry.

I wish the directions that came with it had included instructions for piecing and glueing the rosette. I had difficulties making the paper strips to lie flat while I was glueing them together and getting them to form a circle.

The directions on how to use these dies with the Spellbinders Wizard, the Big Kick by Sizzix, and the Cuttlebug by Provocraft come with every set of dies, and they are very clear and easy to follow. However, the two large crosses did not cut cleanly when I applied them to Bazzill cardstock. I had to finish cutting out the center decorations with my trusty X-Acto knife, using a #11 blade. If you experience similiar problems, try rotating the die and paper 90 degrees and running it through your die-cutting machine a second time. When this didn't completely cut through the paper, I added a second sheet of paper, then flipped the first sheet of paper and die over, so that the two sheets of paper touched each other, then ran it through my Cuttlebug a third time. This technique gave me the cleanest cut, but I still had to finish the most complicated cross (the large green cross in the illustration) with my X-Acto knife. These crosses make very nice decorations for Easter greeting cards (see customer image above for an example using the large curly cross.) I just wish they cut a bit more cleanly.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Kaleidacolor is Tsukineko's multicolor (\"rainbow\") dye inkpad that is supposed to provide a continuous inking surface when in use, after the pads are pushed together. There is a button that makes it easy to slide the pads up next to each other. The bad news is that the button sticks up above the individual ink pads, so you can't really get at the colors nearest the button, unless you arrange to use the pad at the very edge of your work table, so that the button protrudes into space when you stamp down. Even when I used this technique, the pushed-together colors did not stamp evenly. The 'Baby' text in the customer image of an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") Baby card is colored with this Blue Breeze inkpad. I like the idea of the push-together pads. It just needs a bit more engineering to make it really work.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I tried all sorts of ink pads until I finally found this Distress Ink pad from Jim Holz. It's advertised as creating \"an aged look on papers, fibers, photos & more\" which wasn't quite what I was looking for. But it also works very well for coloring a raised pattern after I've run my cardstock through my Cuttlebug with an embossing folder. Please see the customer image for a birthday card that I embossed with a graduation-themed folder, then colored with the tattered rose Distress Ink pad (the background to the main image). Tattered Rose is more beige than rose, but I like the color. The only drawback to using this Distress Ink pad is that it takes a few minutes to dry.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Review: I've used both a Cricut cutter and the&nbsp;Pazzles Inspiration Electronic Cutter, and the Pazzles Inspiration wins, hands down. You don't have to buy expensive cartridges with the Inspiration, and the software is far superior. The only drawback I've discovered so far is that the Inspiration cutting mats are slightly more expensive. I think the extra few dollars are worth paying--however, I'm tempted to purchase a Cricut mat just to see if it works in the Inspiration. Essentially they're both 12\"x12\" mats, coated with a sticky surface film. When I first got my Inspiration, I set the cutting blade too deep for card stock and ended up scarring the mat, but I was still able to use it. The Inspiration users' manual suggests using a lint roller to clean the mat, and this really works! When new, the mat is very, very sticky so you really have to know how to clean it, and also how to pry delicate cuttings away from the surface. I use an X-acto knife for the latter operation.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

My Silhouette Portrait machine has a setting for Silhouette Vinyl sheets, but not for other brands. I went ahead and cut down the PrimeCuts vinyl sheet to 8.5\" x 11\" and ran it through with a cutting blade, just as though I was cutting card stock. It worked okay, but next time I'm going to follow the instructions that came with the Silhouette and leave out the cutting mat and use the transfer paper. Vinyl cuts much cleaner lettering than card stock if you use it correctly. Please see customer image for an A7 (5\" x 7\") graduation card, where the phrase 'Ace Graduate' is cut from PrimeCut black vinyl on my Silhouette Portrait machine.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Kaleidacolor is Tsukineko's multicolor (\"rainbow\") dye inkpad that is supposed to provide a continuous inking surface when in use, after the pads are pushed together. There is a button that makes it easy to slide the pads up next to each other. The bad news is that the button sticks up above the individual ink pads, so you can't really get at the colors nearest the button, unless you arrange to use the pad at the very edge of your work table, so that the button protrudes into space when you stamp down. Even when I used this technique, the pushed-together colors did not stamp evenly. The yellow was especially hard to stamp (see customer image). However, when I used the 'smear' technique, I did get a nice, random array of colors to decorate the Easter egg in the customer image of an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") Easter card. I like the idea of the push-together pads. It just needs a bit more engineering to make it really work.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

To perform step (3) I left the cut and embossed butterflies in the Shapeabilities dies, so that I could color the embossed (raised) parts of each butterfly. I used&nbsp;Clearsnap Smooch Pearlized Accent Ink Gold Lame By The Each&nbsp;and&nbsp;SMOOCH ACCNTINK GREENAPPLE.3oz Drafting, Engineering, Art (General Catalog)&nbsp;to color the butterflies in the above (Customer Image 1) Sympathy greeting card. Note: the directions that come with the Shapeabilities dies are easy to use, except they fail to mention that if you are using paper that has a decorative print on only one side, be sure to place the printed side of the paper against the cutting side of the die. The directions included with this product explain how to use these dies with the following machines: Big Kick by Sizzix; Original Sizzix Press; CuttleBug by Provocraft (this is the die-cutter/embosser that I use); and the Big Shot machines by Ellison-Sizzix. This is a very nice product, and easy to clean after step (3). I used&nbsp;Cottonelle Fresh Folded Moist Wipes Refill 84&nbsp;to clean my dies.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I've been using it with my Spellbinder Grand Calibur machine. I used my Cottage Cutz metal shim to get a clean cut. Cleaning this die of all the little bits of paper can be a bit of a chore. I don't understand why Spellbinders doesn't put a cutting edge around the outside of the main die. Instead, you get a separate, rectangular die in this two-piece set. This frame die cuts a background rectangle that just fits onto an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") greeting card. Please see customer image for an A2 anniversary card that I made with the main die. Please be aware that if you use more than one color of paper in the background (I used four: blue, dark yellow, copper foil, and green glitter), you're going to be doing some fiddly cutting.

My big problem with the stencil is that I couldn't get it to lie completely flat, even though I completely taped down the outer edge. Since I couldn't get the stencil to lie flat, some of the paste sneaked under the stencil (I was applying the paste with a Heritage Handicrafts mini-squeegee) and messed up the design. According to the advertising that comes with this stencil, you can use it in conjunction with chalk and ink or paint spritzers, but even with these products you'll need to get the stencil to lie flat.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I applied the paste with a Heritage Handicrafts mini-squeegee. The directions on the jar of embossing paste weren't completely clear as to when the stencil should be removed from the cardstock after the paste was applied, so the first time I used it, I let the paste dry before I lifted the plastic stencil. This was a mistake, as the stencil stuck to the cardstock and ripped up part of the dried paste when I tried to remove it. The second application went more smoothly as I lifted the stencil as soon as I finished applying the paste. I'm still not completely satisfied with this embossing paste, as it causes the cardstock to warp as it dries. It's also hard to apply it to the smaller openings in the stencil. The color does dry to a metallic copper finish, exactly as advertised. I think the next time I'll try it on watercolor paper, which will be less prone to warping than the 80 lb. cardstock. NOTE: this paste works much better on watercolor paper and with brass stencils, rather than the plastic variety.

The sample card with the hollowed-out heart that is shown in the above product photograph needs yet another bit of equipment: the Sizzix Movers & Shapers Magnetic Die Set 2PK - Hearts Set. If you have a small heart die from Spellbinders, you can create the hollow heart pop-up in two steps: (1) run your card stock through your Sizzix machine to create your circular pop-up, using the Pop 'n Cuts Insert, then (2) run your cardstock back through your Sizzix machine with your Spellbinder's heart die centered on the circle. This will give you a hollowed-out heart which is very similiar to the one shown in the product photograph. I've been making pop-up valentines ever since I got my Sizzix Pop 'n Cuts die set. They're really cute, just a bit complicated to make. Luckily, there are lots of helpful videos out on Youtube that demonstrate how to make pop-up cards with this product.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

This particular example, the Morning Glory yields eight pieces of paper: the vine with leaves, which measures about 3.5 inches in length and 1.75 inches in width; and seven flowers. Text-weight (60 lb) paper seems to yield the cleanest cut. When I attempted to cut regular cardstock (80 lb) with this die, I had to use a shim in order to get a clean cut. All of the Cottage Cutz dies come with a thin piece of sticky-backed foam that you fit over the die face. That's all the preparation that is necessary to use their dies. I used my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine to cut this die. Please see customer image for an example of a Get Well greeting card that was made with this die.

This product is advertised as acid-free and non-toxic. Diamond is a great all-around color to use many different types of greeting cards to add just a touch of glitter to an object. That's why I've started buying it in bulk. The glue itself is transparent, so all you see is a spattering of rainbow-colored glitter, once the glue dries.

I have also used them for sympathy cards. Please see customer image for an A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") birthday card where I employed three of the four dies. I do have a problem with the way these dies are made: the straight (non-decorated) edges of these dies are NOT cutting edges. The smallest die has no cutting edges at all, except for those that cut out the small fleur de lis patterns. Why are they made like this? I always have to go in with my #11 X-acto blade and cut my own straight edges. I had to use a metal shim when make the initial die cut with my Spellbinders Grand Calibur machine. I've discovered that the best way to clean dies with lots of little pieces of paper that stick to the metal is to soak the die in warm water for a couple of minutes, then dig out the excess paper with a stiff-bristled brush, using small circular motions.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

Each color within this wide and balanced spectrum of 96 colors, has been selected and formulated to offer the greatest choice so that artists can use a unique palette that best suits their work.

This is particularly important because transparency is the key characteristic of water colour. As a result of the thinness of the water colour film, all colours have a transparent quality on paper, allowing the reflective white of the paper to shine through. However, pigments do retain their natural characteristics to some degree.

The only plates I really needed to replace were the base (gray) and cutting (white) plates, but this set comes with all three plates plus the plastic tray that fits into the base of the machine. The plates are quite substantial, but they do get cut up by the dies, so that's why I eventually replaced them.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I tried all sorts of ink pads until I finally found this vintage photo Distress Ink pad from Jim Holz. It's advertised as creating \"an aged look on papers, fibers, photos & more\" which wasn't quite what I was looking for. But it also works very well for coloring a raised pattern after I've run my cardstock through my Cuttlebug with an embossing folder. Please see the customer image for a sympathy card that I embossed with an autumn-themed folder, then colored with the vintage photo Distress Ink pad. The only drawback to using this Distress Ink pad is that it takes a few minutes to dry.

This particular die makes quite an elegant corner for a variety of different cards, including wedding, friendship, and birthday (see customer image for a wedding card I made from four die-cuts from this die). My only problem with 'Scrolly Corner' is that if you cut four pieces for a frame, the only card it will fit is a 6\" square card. Here in the USA, we have to pay extra postage for square cards, so I don't usually make them. I was able to remove bits from the die-cuts and get them to fit on a 5.5\" square card, for which I had a standard square envelope. Note to the Manufacturer: Dear Die-Namites, if you want to sell lots of corner dies, please make ones that will fit on a standard A2 (5.5\" x 4.25\") greeting card.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

This precision-tip applicator bottle is the closest I've ever found to the perfect gluing bottle. If you are careful how you squeeze the plastic bottle, you can apply fine dots or lines of glue to your paper.

Sometimes the attached tip gets in my way when I'm gluing a particularly detailed cut-out, but that's a minor inconvenience.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

I tried gluing the bow to the package top, and then gluing the bottom of the bow onto the package body, but had trouble lining up the top with the body. What seemed to work better for me was to glue an extra piece of paper behind the package body, with a little strip sticking up over the top.

I use them with my Spellbinders Grand Calibur Embossing & Die Cutting Machine, and according to the directions that come with the dies, they also work with the Cuttlebugs and the Sizzix machines. The directions that come with these dies explain very clearly how to use them with each type of embossing/die-cutting machine. NOTE: if you are accumulating quite a collection of these Spellbinders dies, you might find it handy to create a binder to hold them. I bought a three-inch binder and about 28 feet of 1/2\" magnetic tape, and made pages out of cardboard and chipboard. I stuck the magnetic tape onto both sides of a cardboard page, usually in a cross-shape, then stuck the dies to the magnetic tape. The dies are much easier to remove and put back onto the magnetic tape than they were to take off and put back onto onto the sticky tape that Spellbinders uses to package them. Plus all my dies are in one place now, and very easy to access. See second customer image above for a sample page from my 'metal dies' binder.\n\n**Task:**\nYou are an expert product analyst.

It's more of a hobby item for papercrafters. I use it in conjunction with a rubber stamp to decorate greeting cards (see image above). The four colors of ink--green, blue, rose, and mauve--go quite well together, and the resulting image is imbued with a metallic sheen. I've been stamping hearts and swans on Valentine cards with this 'enchanted evening' pad. The hues are soft, rather than saturated with color. My only problem with the inks in this pad is that they do not set completely, and will smear even after 24-hours (this was on Aquarelle Arches hot-pressed watercolor paper, 140 lb. weight).

These Tonic Studios scissors are for the in-between stuff such as stars, circles, tags, and medium-to-large letters. I found it a bit hard at first, to accommodate myself to the ratcheting action of the blades, but once I was used to it, I found it very handy when cutting circles and curved lines.

She wanted a comprehensive craft tool that would be universal with manufacturers' existing products, cut, emboss, be portable and be sturdy enough to withstand the test of time. Innovations continue with the Grand Calibur machine and the Presto Punch machine, the first automatic punching and embossing system. Spellbinders Paper Arts entered the craft and hobby market in 2003 and now has more than 250 patented and patent pending products under the trade names of Nestabilities, Edgeabilities, Shapeabilities, Borderabilities and Nesties. Layering, patterns and detail seem to be the buzz words on everyone's lips this year, so we've made sure to create a fabulous assortment of new die designs that give you all three and bring you wonderful options for creativity. Spellbinders Nestabilities Card Creator, in collaboration with Cindy Echtinaw, brings a simple and unique solution to multiple crafting projects. The work's all done for you, no more measuring required. Based on the ever popular Nestabilities line, the new Card Creator die templates are sized to work with standard A2 size cards. The collection includes 2 basic matting sets, sizes A and B. When using Size A or B within their respective sets, incrementing will be achieved at 1/4-inch. When combining A and B, 1/8-inch incrementing is achieved. The other four sets offer decorative designs that are perfectly proportioned for an A2 card. Simply choose your design, assemble your pieces, refine the details and you're done. A unique set that is a must have for anyone who loves to add ribbon to their cards and projects. The fancy edges and details are added bonus in this four piece set. Approximate die template sizes are: Label; 1-5/8 by 5/8-inch, Accent; 2-3/4 by 7/8-inch, Small rectangle; 1-7/8 by 3-1/8-inch and Large rectangle; 3-7/8 by 5-1/8-inch.\"]\n\n**Product Features:**\n- The Nestabilities Card Creator brings a simple and unique solution to multiple crafting projects\n- The fancy edges and details add a unique look to cards and paper projects\n- Cindy Echtinaw brings fancy and easy to use design to creative projects\n\n\n**Known Product Attributes (from Knowledge Base):**\n- Brand: Spellbinders\n- Main Category: Arts, Crafts & Sewing\n- Category: Arts, Crafts & Sewing, Die-Cuts, Die-Cutting & Embossing, Scrapbooking & Stamping\n- Price Range: $10-$25\n\n**User Review Content:**\nTitle: Useful Dies for all sorts of greeting cards Review: The Spellbinders A-2 Fancy Ribbon die set is useful for all sorts of greeting cards.

It takes awhile to clean the dies after they've been used, but the two larger dies are designed so that you can thread ribbon through the slots and twine through the smaller holes. Please see customer image for an example of a baby card that was made with the largest die.
