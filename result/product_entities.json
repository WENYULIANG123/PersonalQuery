          "Add luminous color to your artwork with this 30-piece assortment of Neocolor II Water-soluble Artists' Pastels from Caran d'Ache. These superior-quality artists' pastels meet the exacting requirements of fine artists, illustrators, graphic artists and teachers. Use these soft, water-soluble pastels to create beautiful watercolor effects. Simply make a sketch with Neocolor II pastels, then sprinkle it with water and allow the colors to dilute. Use a brush to pick up colors and paint as though with watercolors. You can also draw on moistened paper for a wash and varnish effect. Neocolor II Artists' Pastels have a high pigment concentration that results in bright, opaque colors, suitable for many techniques on dry or wet paper. Neocolor II water-soluble wax pastels are a product of Caran d'Ache innovation. They combine the expertise of a color specialist with the great ''Swiss Made'' tradition. Neocolor II wax pastels are exceptional, both for their quality and the techniques they make possible. Neocolor provides inspiration and opportunity for all professional and amateur artists to fully express their talent and imagination. Set is packaged in a metal tin.

          "DANIEL SMITH Extra Fine Watercolors - classic watercolors of unsurpassed purity and permanence. The vision in the formulation of DANIEL SMITH watercolors was twofold; First and foremost, to produce watercolors that are the best in lightfastness and permanence. Second, to offer a selection of truly unique colors. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are formulated to meet and exceed the highest industry standards for the manufacture of artists paints, and every batch made is tested and analyzed for its performance qualities. DANIEL SMITH is truly the worldwide leader of watercolors for artists with 240+ beautiful colors in the 15ml watercolors, the most of any manufacturer. Many are traditional colors relied upon by all artists, and there are many truly unique colors made only by DANIEL SMITH that have become so important to watercolor artists. PrimaTek Watercolors are made from minerals, often semi precious minerals, that have been ground into pigments, mixed with gum arabic (the binder) and milled into PrimaTek Watercolors. The first was Lapis Lazuli Genuine in 1998, since then, many more have been added such as Amethyst Genuine, Piemontite Genuine and Serpentine Genuine. Most of these colors have wonderful granulating effects that some artists have called magical. Luminescent Watercolors have special optical effects perfect for subjects that have a sparkle, sheen, or reflective glow like the iridescence of hummingbird feathers or the sheen of metals. Cadmium Hues, DANIEL SMITH has developed safe and vibrant Cadmium Hues with the density and richness of cadmium colors without the cadmium pigment. Virtually identical in color to their namesakes, they are cleaner in mixtures and much stronger in tints. The working properties staining power, semi-transparency and excellent lightfastness are nearly identical to those of the low-soluble cadmium colors DANIEL SMITH previously manufactured. Some unique colors are created exclusively by DANIEL SMITH like Cascade Green, Green Gold and Moonglow. DANIEL SMITH also finds unusual pigments to make colors like Mayan Red, Lunar Blue and Enviro-Friendly Red Iron Oxide to provide more choices for artists. Other colors are from pigments DANIEL SMITH has sourced, often from very specific locations, colors like Burgundy Yellow Ochre, Monte Amiata Natural Sienna and Roasted French Ochre. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are a favorite of artists all over the world, from professional artists to the beginning watercolorists because of the beautiful colors, consistent performance and lasting color or lightfastness. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are packed with high quality pigments using pure gum arabic as the binder no fillers. For each color, DANIEL SMITH selects the perfect grind to yield particle sizes that maximize the qualities inherent in the pigment, balancing maximum pigment load with minimum vehicle content. DANIEL SMITH offers many ways to experience their Watercolors as well as providing extra creative means for artists with their Watercolor Grounds, Masking Fluid and Walnut Ink. 15ml Watercolors, available in more than 240 colors, the most of any manufacturer. 5ml Watercolors, available in 88 of the most popular colors DANIEL SMITH makes. Watercolor Sticks, 51 popular DANIEL SMITH Watercolors shaped into stick form to draw and paint with, a new way to expressively use watercolors. Watercolor Dot Cards, a great way to try DANIEL SMITH Watercolors without buying whole tubes of paint. These are dots of pure DANIEL SMITH Watercolors that reactivate into paint with the touch of a wet brush, allowing artists to easily and cost effectively, try many colors.

The vision in the formulation of DANIEL SMITH watercolors was twofold; First and foremost, to produce watercolors that are the best in lightfastness and permanence. Second, to offer a selection of truly unique colors. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are formulated to meet and exceed the highest industry standards for the manufacture of artists paints, and every batch made is tested and analyzed for its performance qualities. DANIEL SMITH is truly the worldwide leader of watercolors for artists with 240+ beautiful colors in the 15ml watercolors, the most of any manufacturer. Many are traditional colors relied upon by all artists, and there are many truly unique colors made only by DANIEL SMITH that have become so important to watercolor artists. PrimaTek Watercolors are made from minerals, often semi precious minerals, that have been ground into pigments, mixed with gum arabic (the binder) and milled into PrimaTek Watercolors. The first was Lapis Lazuli Genuine in 1998, since then, many more have been added such as Amethyst Genuine, Piemontite Genuine and Serpentine Genuine. Most of these colors have wonderful granulating effects that some artists have called magical. Luminescent Watercolors have special optical effects perfect for subjects that have a sparkle, sheen, or reflective glow like the iridescence of hummingbird feathers or the sheen of metals. Cadmium Hues, DANIEL SMITH has developed safe and vibrant Cadmium Hues with the density and richness of cadmium colors without the cadmium pigment. Virtually identical in color to their namesakes, they are cleaner in mixtures and much stronger in tints. The working properties staining power, semi-transparency and excellent lightfastness are nearly identical to those of the low-soluble cadmium colors DANIEL SMITH previously manufactured. Some unique colors are created exclusively by DANIEL SMITH like Cascade Green, Green Gold and Moonglow. DANIEL SMITH also finds unusual pigments to make colors like Mayan Red, Lunar Blue and Enviro-Friendly Red Iron Oxide to provide more choices for artists. Other colors are from pigments DANIEL SMITH has sourced, often from very specific locations, colors like Burgundy Yellow Ochre, Monte Amiata Natural Sienna and Roasted French Ochre. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are a favorite of artists all over the world, from professional artists to the beginning watercolorists because of the beautiful colors, consistent performance and lasting color or lightfastness. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are packed with high quality pigments using pure gum arabic as the binder no fillers. For each color, DANIEL SMITH selects the perfect grind to yield particle sizes that maximize the qualities inherent in the pigment, balancing maximum pigment load with minimum vehicle content. DANIEL SMITH offers many ways to experience their Watercolors as well as providing extra creative means for artists with their Watercolor Grounds, Masking Fluid and Walnut Ink. 15ml Watercolors, available in more than 240 colors, the most of any manufacturer. 5ml Watercolors, available in 88 of the most popular colors DANIEL SMITH makes.
