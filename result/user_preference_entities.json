Each stick was wrapped in spongy foam. Each stick is stamped with a number, so I downloaded the color chart from Blick to get the color names. I swatched these dry, then did some wet tests in a coloring book with good paper. I wetted a paint brush, swirled it on the stick to pick up color and painted some flowers. The color was amazing. The pigment was strong and rich. It really popped out and it dried fast. The color rivaled most of the watercolor pencils I own. When I wanted to clean up the color like when I color outside the lines, it lifts easily with an eraser. I used the Faber-Castell pencil eraser with brush. I wish there was some way to carry these around when I travel, but this box of 96 is too large and bulky. Overall, I love these!",

I put a Magic Bobbin Genie in the bobbin case and it seemed to make it worse. This little machine is for very basic stitching and repair jobs. You will not create any haute couture garment on this, but it is useful. This is small and very lightweight, what I would consider truly portable without being heavy. The machine and its accessories slip easily inside a tote bag. My only gripe, so far, is the size of the presser foot. It is a little too big and makes threading the needle more difficult. I had to use a needle threader to pull the thread through. It cannot be changed out for a smaller foot.",

I made thick swatches to see how deep the vibrancy goes. I used a nylon water brush with water and a wet towelette to wipe the color. The colors cleaned up easily and left nothing on my fingers. Some colors really pop on the the paper. I used 140 lb cold press watercolor paper which has a distinct tooth I see as I lay down color. Trying to pick my favorite colors was difficult since I like just about all of them. I was impressed by the three metallic crayons. They really do look metallic. Bronze is particularly pretty. I believe that the colors we receive depends on when and where these are ordered. There are some sets that have a different color set, but the ones coming from Blick contain the following colors listed after my review. Blick also has loose stock for reordering. If they weren't so bulky to transport, these might easily have taken the place of my pencils. The tin is nice and sturdy, but heavy. I like the metal tray that holds the first plastic tray. The flimsy plastic tray is no good by itself. Overall, I am impressed by the quality and creaminess of the crayons. I do wish I could get all 126 colors.\n\n001 White\n002 Silver Gray\n003 Light Gray\n005 Gray\n007 Dark Gray\n008 Grayish Black\n009 Black\n010 Yellow\n011 Pale Yellow\n020 Golden Yellow\n028 Toledo Brown\n030 Orange\n031 Orangish Yellow\n033 Golden Ochre\n035 Ochre\n036 Raw Sienna\n039 Olive Brown\n041 Apricot\n042 Flesh\n045 Vandycke Brown\n049 Raw Umber\n050 Flame Red\n051 Salmon\n052 Saffron\n055 Cinnamon\n059 Brown\n060 Vermilion\n063 English Red\n065 Russet\n069 Burnt Sienna\n070 Scarlet\n071 Salmon Pink\n080 Carmine\n081 Pink\n090 Purple\n099 Aubergine\n100 Purple Violet\n110 Lilac\n111 Mauve\n120 Violet\n130 Royal Blue\n131 Periwinkle Blue\n139 Indigo Blue\n140 Ultramarine\n141 Sky Blue\n149 Night Blue\n150 Sapphire Blue\n159 Prussian Blue\n160 Cobalt Blue\n161 Light Blue\n171 Turquoise Blue\n180 Malachite Green\n190 Greenish Blue\n191 Turquoise Green\n201 Veronese Green\n210 Emerald Green\n211 Jade Green\n212 Chromium Oxide Green\n220 Grass Green\n225 Moss Green\n229 Dark Green\n230 Yellow Green\n231 Lime Green\n240 Lemon Yellow\n245 Light Olive\n249 Olive\n250 Canary Yellow\n260 Blue\n280 Ruby Red\n300 Fast Orange\n403 Beige\n407 Sepia\n409 Charcoal Gray\n497 Bronze\n498 Metallic Silver\n499 Gold\n508 Paynes Grey\n521 Sahara Yellow\n560 Light Cadmium Red\n589 Crimson Alizarin\n661 Light Cobalt Blue\n710 Phthalocyanine Green\n720 Bright Green\n730 Chinese Green",

I hope they meet my expectations because these look so great.\n\nUpdate: I received my Singer S10 Studio embroidery machine Christmas Eve. I practiced on a piece of muslin with lightweight stabilizer. I used #580 green to stitch out the safety pin design. My machine had no problem accepting the thread. The invididual colors in the thread seem to be very long, so you won't get a mixed color effect on a small design.

The number of pastels in this set is great, unlike the major colored pencil makers who seem to concentrate on medium or darker colors. There is a set of six colors called luminous that are like neons. Their colors really pop on the page. There are colors that I wish I had before in other sets but finally I have them in this one. They lay down easily and feel creamy when coloring. I have a good batch of PrismaColor Premiers which also feel very creamy and these excel that set. The set came in a very nice paper box but I also bought a separate case because I like to travel with my pencils. There is literature inside giving a full list of the color names and numbers but it is in Japanese. Whether you are a professional artist or an amateur, you should find these pencils a joy to work with, once you get past the price.\n\nColor list of 150:\n011 Cherry Blossom\n019 Snow Pink\n022 Pink\n024 Coral\n028 Salmon Pink\n031 Carnation\n040 Rose\n042 Carmine\n043 Signal Red\n044 Scarlet\n046 Vermilion\n047 Tiger Lily\n048 Orange\n051 Strawberry\n052 Madder Red\n054 Light Red\n057 Burnt Sienna\n059 Autumn Leaf\n060 Wine Red\n062 Crimson\n076 Ash Rose\n080 Burgundy\n086 Chocolate\n093 Mahogany\n096 Cinnamon\n097 Brick\n098 Cocoa\n099 Brown\n116 Ivory\n120 Peach\n122 Jaune Brillant\n123 Flesh\n127 Cream\n131 Apricot\n134 Naples Yellow\n140 Tangerine\n142 Marigold\n143 Sunflower\n145 Dandelion\n147 Canary Yellow\n149 Lemon\n153 Yellow Ochre\n165 Mustard\n171 Cork\n173 Beige\n175 Sand\n180 Burnt Umber\n182 Sepia\n184 Raw Umber\n187 Olive Drab\n189 Olive Green\n192 Tan\n194 Khaki\n195 Olive Brown\n198 Olive Yellow\n222 Lettuce Green\n225 Cobalt Green\n227 Jade Green\n228 Ice Green\n235 Emerald Green\n240 Chartreuse Green\n242 Spring Green\n243 Fresh Green\n245 Summer Green\n247 Viridian\n248 Peacock Green\n251 Apple Green\n254 Evergreen\n255 Malachite Green\n262 Sap Green\n264 Holly Green\n267 Forest Green\n269 Triton Green\n270 Willow Green\n271 Opal Green\n272 Misty Green\n274 Mint Green\n275 Surf Green\n277 Celadon\n288 Fir Green\n290 Moss Green\n291 Leaf Green\n292 Cactus Green\n294 Jasper Green\n296 Bottle Green\n312 Horizon Blue\n321 Porcelain Blue\n323 Aqua\n324 Sky Blue\n326 Forget-me-not Blue\n328 Lavender Blue\n335 Cerulean Blue\n339 Smart Blue\n340 Peacock Blue\n343 Turquoise Blue\n345 Spectrum Blue\n347 Cobalt Blue\n348 Royal Blue\n349 Ultra Blue\n365 Navy Blue\n368 Prussian Blue\n371 Sky Mist\n379 Smoke Blue\n395 Saxe Blue\n422 Lilac\n429 Rose Pink\n430 Wisteria\n434 Mauve\n436 Fuchsia\n437 Cosmos\n440 Pansy\n441 Violet\n443 Iris\n446 Amethyst\n448 Azalea\n449 Magenta\n460 Indigo\n469 Bordeaux Red\n476 Sea Fog\n481 Grape\n486 Raisin\n495 Rose Grey\n500 White\n501 Soft White\n510 Black\n511 Lamp Black\n521 Warm Grey #1\n522 Warm Grey #2\n523 Warm Grey #3\n524 Warm Grey #4\n525 Warm Grey #5\n526 Warm Grey #6\n531 Cool Grey #1\n532 Cool Grey #2\n533 Cool Grey #3\n534 Cool Grey #4\n535 Cool Grey #5\n536 Cool Grey #6\n600 Gold\n610 Pale Gold\n620 Bronze\n630 Copper\n640 Silver\n650 Antique Silver\n700 Luminous Red\n710 Luminous Rose\n720 Luminous Opera\n730 Luminous Orange\n740 Luminous Lemon\n750 Luminous Green",

Although the unused thread is plastic wrapped, the dome cap is a nice touch. I will update when I stitch something.\n\n01/12 update: I stitched a quilt block pattern with this thread and the result was stunning. I watched a Nancy Zeimen video on YouTube about embellishing with embroidery using metallic thread. A good polyester can personalize a garment wonderfully, but using metallic thread can transform it into a greater work of art. The way metallic thread catches light cannot be matched by a polyester or a rayon. I highly recommend using this thread or whatever brand you prefer.",

Computerized sewing and embroidery machines combine both worlds. I have an old New Home Memory Craft 5000. It's great for sewing but embroidery can be cumbersome. This machine is up-to-date with a USB stick on which to save my own designs along with the collection stored in the machine. I used the Kolors Embroidery 20 Spools White & Black Embroidery Machine Thread for my bobbin and one of the greens from my ThreadNanny 25 Spools Varigated Poly Machine Embroidery Thread collection. I practiced with a piece of muslin with lightweight stabilizer and stitched out the safety pin design. I tried it twice using each hoop and both times it skipped a stitch in the same place. I will play with the tension to prevent that from happening again. I cannot follow the tutorials on the machine so I watch the YouTube videos which are quite good quality. If one wishes to purchase a carrying case or tote, the actual dimensions of my machine are 19\" long x 12\" high x 12\" deep. The included accessories are of good quality. The scissors seem cheap but they are quite sharp and adequate for snipping threads. Nice as this machine is, I wanted to deduct one star because there were no samples of thread, material and stabilizer to practice with when I received the machine. Also, the Singerco web site does not list any accessories or replacement parts. A reviewer noted that we can use the Janome MC200E as a reference for compatible parts. Overall, it is a great machine for someone who is between beginner and intermediate skills.",

The difference is that Singer cut the cost by letting all the design work be done on the laptop or PC instead of in the machine. It is easy enough to transfer designs using the USB stick. The variety of embroidery hoop sizes is nice and the endless embroidery hoop is a great addition. The software on the provided USB stick is easy to install and use. I own the BuzzTools editing software, which I bought on this site. One other thing I added was something called the Magic Bobbin Genie, which I also purchased here. It is a little silicone disc that is placed inside the bobbin case under the bobbin for a smoother feed while sewing or embroidering. It is easy to switch between the sewing bed and the embroidery unit. The bobbin winder worked perfectly and I am happy to have the option of using the knee arm attachment to run the machine. There are lots of videos on the Singer web site and YouTube. If you need a carrying case, the whole assembly will fit inside a two-piece trolley set. I liked the blue floral. My only complaint is the inconsistency of Singer customer support. Once I wrote them with a question about an attachment and they responded within a reasonable time, plus they gave me great information. I wrote them again with a question about this machine and I never heard from them. This has a large footprint and it is heavy, but I highly recommend this machine if you are serious about sewing and machine embroidery but need to live within a budget.",

          "reviewText": "The PE535 is a big change from my older embroidery machines. The first thing I noticed was how colorful the unit was. The decor on the body and the backlit computer space were vivid. The accompanying instructions were very clear. The unit has a much smaller footprint than my older Brother ULT-2002D. The 4x4 work space is not as small as some claim, but my designs will not be that large. If I want to embroider something larger, there is a 5x7 hoop available. Three full bobbins and two empty bobbins were included so I could begin embroidering right away. If I need to cancel a design in progress, I can touch the screen to cancel. Every step of the paths for filling a bobbin and threading the machine were numbered to easily follow. The booklets are in multiple languages and there is a separate booklet of all the installed designs and suggestions for combining them into lovely new designs. Thankfully most of the designs are mature drawings and there are enough kiddie designs to satisfy. I was surprised that the power cord was two-prong instead of three. This makes it much easier to plan my work space because not all my walls does have a three-prong plug. The USB flash drive slot can transfer new designs but the drive should be cleared if you want to update the firmware. One negative is that there is no outside drawer to store the tools.",

There are not yet a wide variety of inks available, and it is hard to blend colors outside the bottles. This hobby will get expensive in a hurry if you do a lot of stamping and need to buy additional supplies. It could be a lot of fun and helpful for those who want the ability to create something special. The software was easy to download and install.

What I like about these is that they have real paint brush tips and not flexible marker tips. They worked well and laid down rich vibrant color. I then tried these on a page of a good quality coloring book. The paper seemed to absorb the ink well and there was no bleed-through. The brush can write with broad strokes or very thin ones. It is up to my talent to determine how well these will be used. I need to practice my detailing technique. I think there is a good balance of colors but some people there are not enough of one color or too many of other. There are a number of YouTube videos to show how to use these pens, store them and manage them. Overall I am glad I got these and look forward to coloring some of my favorite pages.",

The colors have numbers but not names. I will spend some time playing with these to see what type of coloring they work best.\n\nUpdate 04/23: I finished a page in my Millie Marotta coloring book. I first colored, then blended, the colors. The colors lay down with a matte finish and are very creamy. They blend well with a blending pencil. The finished product is smooth and glossy. The only problem I had was how the pencils feel in the hand. I sharpened them to a point but it does not last long while coloring. Although the lead was within the pencil casing, it felt like something was loose and broken. I had to be careful not to press too hard. Overall they are nice colors and they lay down well. They blend well and the colors are quite vibrant.",

It is a fine nib but different pressure at a little higher angle can broaden the width of the writing line. I ordered the white and the red. Both are pretty, but the red is subtle under the frosty exterior.\n\n03/30/17: I received the black today. It really looks like a glittering brown with black edging. It is a beautiful pen.",
